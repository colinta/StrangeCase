======================
The Strange Case of...
======================

It's yet another static site generator.  Have you seen `jekyll`_?
`hyde`_?  Yup.  Like those.

But this one is:

1. Written in python, unlike ``jekyll``
2. **NOT** complicated, unlike ``hyde``.  And I mean *really* **NOT** complicated.

I just read about `webby`_, and realized that it is the Ruby equivalent to
StrangeCase.  I commend them!  I had considered porting StrangeCase to Ruby
(and maybe I will some day, just for kicks), but for now, I would say to
Rubyists: use `webby`_.

---------------------------------------------------------

------------
INSTALLATION
------------

::

    $ pip install StrangeCase
    $ scase  # generates the site
    $ scase --watch  # generates the site and watches
                     # for changes to source files


-----
HELP!
-----

Already!?  Geez::

    #strangecase @ irc.freenode.net

    (i'm colinta)


-----------
QUICK START
-----------

1. In your project folder, make a ``site/`` and ``public/`` folder.
2. Put ``index.j2`` in ``site/``, and put some html in there.
3. Add YAML front matter to that file.  It looks like this::

    ---
    title: My first StrangeCase site
    ---
    <!doctype html>
    ...

4. Use that YAML in your page using `Jinja2`_'s template language syntax::

    ---
    title: My first StrangeCase site
    ---
    <!doctype html>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

5. Run strange case:
   ``$ scase``

6. Open ``public/index.html``.  You might want to hold onto your jaw, lest it
   drop to the floor.  Yeah, it's not gonna say ``{{ title }}``, it's gonna say
   ``My First Page`` in big letters.


------------
SLOWER START
------------

Whoopity freakin' do, right?  Let's add a layout and create a site.

At this point this demo site looks like this::

    project
    ├── public
    │   └── index.html
    └── site
        └── index.j2

Add a layouts folder, and put a layout in there::

    project
    ├── layouts
    │   └── base.j2
    ├── public
    │   └── index.html
    └── site
        └── index.j2

``layouts/base.j2`` looks like this::

    <!doctype html>
    <head>
      <title>{{ title or "Nifty Wow!" }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
    </body>

And update ``index.j2`` to use this layout::

    ---
    title: My first StrangeCase site
    ---
    {% extends "layouts/base.j2" %}
    {% block content %}
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    {% endblock %}

You can run StrangeCase again.  ``public/index.html`` will now have ``<head>``
and ``<body>`` tags surrounding it.

If you're lost at this point, you should read up on Jinja.  We haven't really
done anything more than run ``index.j2`` through jinja and wrote the output to
``index.html``.

Now let's add a projects folder and a couple projects.  When you add *content*
to your site, put it in the ``site/`` folder.  Most simple projects will pretty
much only use the ``site/`` folder and a ``layouts/`` folder wth one or two
layouts in there.

I'm going to throw a curveball into the project file names.  StrangeCase orders
files by sorting them by file name.  This is important when you go to display
images or blogs in order by date.  If you want to have them ordered by anything
other than filename, you can use a couple different naming schemes at the
beginning of the file name.  jekyll does a similar thing, btw.

I'm going to add *two* prefixes so we can see what happens when we process
files this way.

::

    project
    ├── layouts
    │   └── base.j2
    ├── public
    │   └── ...
    └── site
        ├── index.j2
        └── projects
            ├── 001_2012_02_27_first_project.j2   #
            ├── 002_2012_02_28_second_project.j2  # look over here!
            └── 003_2012_02_27_third_project.j2   #

And here is what each project template looks like::

    {% extends "layouts/base.j2" %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>Project number #{{ order }} started on {{ created_at | date }}</p>
    {% endblock %}

A little shorter than our original ``index.j2``.  Notice I've left out the YAML
front matter, and yet I am using the variables `title`, `order`, and
`created_at`.  Where do they get their value from?

The file name!

::

    001_2012_02_27_first_project
    \+/ \---+----/ \-----+-----/
     |      |            |
     |      |            +-title
     |      |
     |      +-created_at
     |
     +-order

In this way, you get some variables for free just by naming your files with a
date and/or order prefix. Later, you'll be able to write your own function that
does this — and more!  We are looking at the by-product of “configurators”, and
they can access and modify the entire config for the node.

BUT, if you tried to run StrangeCase right now, you would get the following
error::

    $ scase
    ...
    jinja2.exceptions.TemplateAssertionError: no filter named 'date'

No worries, there is a `date` filter built into StrangeCase.  It's just not
enabled. So add a config.yaml file to the project root::

    project
    ├── config.yaml
    ├── layouts
    │   └── base.j2
    ├── public
    │   └── ...
    └── site
        ├── index.j2
        └── projects
            ├── 001_2012_02_27_first_project.j2
            ├── 002_2012_02_28_second_project.j2
            └── 003_2012_02_27_third_project.j2

and add the date filter::

    filters:
      date: strange_case.extensions.date.date

*Now* you can run StrangeCase with no errors, which will generate::

    <!doctype html>
    <head>
      <title>Nifty Wow!</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1></h1>
    <p>Project number #1 started on 27 Feb 2012</p>

    </body>

Moving along.  Now let's create a project listing at ``projects/index.j2``.  We
need a way to "fetch" the project pages.  This is going to be very easy,
because really all that StrangeCase *does* is build a resource tree.  And we
can walk that tree using the node names.  So if we just iterate over the
``projects/`` folder, we'll have our project nodes.

Add ``index.j2`` to ``site/projects/`` ::

    project
    ├── config.yaml
    ├── layouts
    │   └── base.j2
    ├── public
    │   └── ...
    └── site
        ├── index.j2
        └── projects
            ├── index.j2    # <===
            ├── 001_2012_02_27_first_project.j2
            ├── 002_2012_02_28_second_project.j2
            └── 003_2012_02_27_third_project.j2

``index.j2``::

    {% extends "layouts/base.j2" %}

    {% block content %}
    {% for project in site.projects %}
    <p><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.title }}</a></p>
    {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

Iterating over folders is a very easy thing to do in StrangeCase.  It's how you
do things like create an index page, as we saw here, or create a photo blog
(``for photo in site.images.my_fun_trip``).  It is what I found very
frustrating in ``jekyll`` and ``hyde`` (especially ``jekyll``), and so it's
what is *very easy* in ``StrangeCase``.

Notice that when we iterate over the ``site.projects`` folder, it does *not*
include the ``index.html`` file.  Makes sense, though, right?  The index page
is considered to be the same "page" as the folder.  Even though they are
seperate nodes, they have the same URL.

To wrap things up, let's make a link to the project page from the home page.
Every node has a ``url`` property, and you can access pages by their name.
"name" is whatever is "leftover" after the created_at date and order have been
pulled out.  I'll add a link to the second project to demonstrate this::

    ---
    title: My first StrangeCase site
    ---
    {% extends "layouts/base.j2" %}
    {% block content %}
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p><a href="{{ site.projects.url }}">Projects</a></p>
    <p>My favorite project: <a href="{{ site.projects.second_project.url }}">My second project</a></p>
    {% endblock %}


This wraps up the tutorial!  Now, I'll explain the inner workings.

--------------------
STRANGECASE OVERVIEW
--------------------

StrangeCase parses all the files and directories in ``site/``.

* Files/Folders that match ``ignore`` are not processed at all.
* Folders become ``FolderNode`` objects (``site/``, though, is a ``RootNode``)
  and scanned recursively.
* Pages (html and jinja files) become ``JinjaNode(FileNode)`` objects.
* Assets (javascript, css, images) become ``AssetNode(FileNode)`` objects.
* These can be overridden using the ``type`` config.
* Additional nodes can be created by including the appropriate processor and
  setting the node's ``type`` to use that processor.

The nodes are placed in a tree::

    (root, aka site)                    # RootNode
    | static/                           # FolderNode
    | | css/                            # FolderNode
    | | + style.css                     # AssetNode
    | \ image/                          # FolderNode
    |   | img1.png                      # AssetNode (or possibly ImageNode)
    |   | img2.png                      # AssetNode
    |   + img3.png                      # AssetNode
    | robots.txt                        # PageNode
    | index (index.j2 => index.html)    # PageNode
    \ blogs/                            # FolderNode
      | test1 (test1.j2 => test1.html)  # PageNode
      + test2 (test2.j2 => test2.html)  # PageNode

-------------------
HUH? WHA' HAPPENED?
-------------------

Here is a more thorough 1-2-3 of what StrangeCase does when you run it.

1 - Build stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the build stage, StrangeCase is looking at the files and folders in site/.
First a root node is created::

    root_node = build_node(config, site_path, deploy_path, '')[0]

The ``build_node`` method **configures** and **processes** the node.
**configures** means that it passes the ``source_path`` and ``config`` to each
of the ``configurators`` (we saw these working in the tutorial above:
``date_from_name``, ``order_from_name``, and ``title_from_name`` in
particular).  **processes** means that one or more nodes are instantiated and
added to the node tree.  The ``root_node`` sits at the top, and in your
templates you access it using ``{{ site }}``.

This process continues recursively for every file and folder in site (except
``ignore``-d files).

1.a - Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you run StrangeCase, it immediately starts building a config object. This
object will be used throughout the generation of your site, so it is important
to understand what it does, and how you control it.

First, ``strange_case_config.py`` establishes the initial defaults.  Look at
that file, or read about the defaults below.  Next, the project config file is
merged in.  This is the ``config.yaml`` file that sits at the top of your
project.  Then command-line arguments are processed.  **Finally**, if a function
is assigned to ``config_hook``, it will be passed the configuration, and it is
expected to throw errors or make changes to that object as needed.  This is how
"scaffolding" is accomplished, which is actually just a StrangeCase extension
and a few handy ``site/`` folders.

When a new node is being built, it starts

There are many ways that configuration can be added to a node during the build
stage.  The first way is inheritance.  Nodes inherit all the configuration of
the parent node except for the keys that are in ``dont_inherit`` (name,
target_name, type, and most of the config options that are assigned by
configurators).

If the node is a folder, the special file config.yaml will be merged into that
node if it exists.  If it is a file node, the parent folder's config is checked
for a ``files`` entry, and if the current file is in there, that config is
merged in.  ``page`` types can have YAML front matter.

See the section below that outlines the default config, and how those options
affect processing.  Know this: everything is controlled using config.  If you're
trying to do something complicated and having trouble, please create an issue.
I'd like to compile a list of HOWTOs/FAQs.

1.b - Processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the build stage, page, folder, and asset nodes are created using
**processors**.  There are four built-in processors, and more available as
extensions.  One important thing to note here is that assets and pages are
differentiated only by the fact that one of them is passed through Jinja2.  If
you want to process a JavaScript file through Jinja2, you should associate
"*.js" with the ``page`` type, or set ``type: page`` in the parent folder
config.yaml file (using the ``files:`` dictionary)::

    file_types:
        - [page, '*.js']
    # or, if you want to only process a couple files:
        - [page, ['special.js', 'special-2.js']]

    # or just assign the 'page' processor
    files:
      special.js: { type: page }

``type`` is not inherited, but ``file_types`` is, so you can set a whole folder
of assets to become page nodes using this config.


2 - Populating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the category processor this stage is important.  If you're not,
it won't matter.

Some nodes can't know what content they will generate until the entire site is
scanned.  Like categories!  We need to know *all* the pages in the site before
we know what all the categories are, and how many pages have that category.

These nodes are stored as ``Processor``s, and they are nodes that say "hold
on, I'm not ready yet...".  They must implement a ``populate`` method, which
when called *removes* the processor node from the tree and replaces itself with
nodes (or it can insert nodes elsewhere in the tree, or do nothing I suppose).

If you are writing your own processor, and need to access a node's config, use
the item-index operators, ``[]``.  If the configuration is not set, you'll get
``None`` instead of an ``AttributeError``.

    node.thingy     # => AttributeError
    node['thingy']  # => None

3 - Generating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the nodes are instantiated and are arranged in a tree structure, with the root node at the top.  The ``generate``
method is called on the root node, and recursively on all the children.  This is where folders are created, pages are generated, and
assets are copied over.  If you are using the image processor, you might also have thumbnails created using `PIL`_.

---------
TEMPLATES
---------

In your templates, you have access to anything in the inherited config and in per-page metadata:

``/config.yaml``::

    meta:
      author:
        name: "Colin"

``/site/index.j2``::

    ---
    # YAML front matter
    title: test
    ---

    <h1>{{ meta.author.name }}</h1>
    <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
    <h2>{{ my.title }}</h2>

Generates::

    <h1>Colin</h1>
    <h2>test</h2>
    <h2>test</h2>

Accessing any node by name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a common thing to do in StrangeCase.  The ``name``, if it is not explicitly declared, is detemined by the
file name.  The default configurators will remove ordering (``order_from_name``) and date (``date_from_name``)
from the front, and then the default name (``setdefault_name``) will be the file name with non-alphanumerics
replaced with underscores, lowercased, and the html extension is removed.  All other extensions will remain.

``This is a file name - DUH.j2`` becomes ``this_is_a_file_name___duh``

``WHAT, a great image?.jpg`` becomes ``what__a_great_image_jpg``

Example of accessing the "Best blog ever" page's URL::

    <a href="{{ site.blogs.best_blog_ever.url }}">Best blog ever</a>.

All nodes except the root node (``site`` is the root node, if you haven't noticed) have ``siblings`` nodes, a ``next``
node, and a ``prev`` node.  If this is the first / last node, ``prev`` / ``next`` returns None.  ``siblings`` always
returns a list, and at the minimum the current node will be in there (even the root node, but why you would call ``site.siblings``
is beyond me).

Iterating over folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've already seen this, but I'll include it again for completeness::

    {% for blog in site.blogs %}
    <p>{{ loop.index }}. {{ blog.title }}</p>
    {% endfor %}

=> ::

    <p>1. Blog Title</p>
    <p>2. Blog Title</p>

**Note:** Files named ``index.html`` will not be included in this list.  This is a
very reasonable design decision, but I can imagine a situation where you have a file (think
``robots.txt``) that *also* doesn't belong in the iterable pages list.  So ``iterable: false`` is
available as a config setting.

Iterate over a folder of images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    {% for image in site.static.image %}
    <img src="{{ image.url }}" />
    {% endfor %}

**BAM**, how's that for an image listing!  This might be my favorite thing in StrangeCase: that folders are
iterable.  It makes things that were weird in jekyll (``site.categories.blablabla``) very easy,
and intuitive, I think, since you only have to know the folder name of your images/blogs/projects/*whatever*.

You might want to check out the image processor, explained below.  It uses `PIL`_ to make thumbnail images.

You can check what kind of node you're working with using the ``type`` property ("page", "folder", "asset") or
the ``is_page``, ``is_folder``, ``is_asset`` methods.  Internally this is done a lot, I can't think of a reason
you would need to do this in a template... but there it is!

Lastly, the ``.all()`` method, and its more specific variants, are very useful.  The ``all()`` method definition
says it all I think::

    def all(self, recursive=False, folders=None, pages=None, assets=None, processors=None):
        """
        Returns descendants, ignoring iterability. Folders, assets, and
        pages can all be included or excluded as the case demands.

        If you specify any of folders, pages, assets or processors, only those objects
        will be returned.
        Otherwise all node types will be returned.

        recursive, though, defaults to False.  calling all(True) is the same as all(recursive=True)
        """

The variants are all subsets of ``all()``::

    def pages(self, recursive=False):
        return self.all(recursive=recursive, pages=True)

    def folders(self, recursive=False):
        return self.all(recursive=recursive, folders=True)

    def assets(self, recursive=False):
        return self.all(recursive=recursive, assets=True)

    def files(self, recursive=False):
        return self.all(recursive=recursive, pages=True, assets=True)

    def processors(self, recursive=False):
        return self.all(recursive=recursive, processors=True)

------
OK, SO
------

Mostly random thoughts here.  Most of what you might want to know about StrangeCase *should* be here, so expect some repetition.

* In your project folder (where you execute StrangeCase), you can have ``config.yaml`` and/or ``config.py``, and you *definitely* have a
  ``site/`` folder, where your site content is stored.  There are probably Jinja2 layouts, includes,
  and who knows what else in the root folder, too.

* ``site/`` stores site content: templates, assets, folders, and maybe some "special" files like category pages.
  These are processed, rendered, copied, or ignored, as the case may be (dot-files are ignored, btw!).

* When StrangeCase is done it places your static site in ``public/``.

* There are only two special folders: site and public. They can be changed in config (``site_path`` and ``dest_path``).

* ``config.yaml`` stores context variables.  It is merged with the default config.  Child folders and pages inherit all the
  config settings of their parent except the variables in ``dont_inherit``:

  + ``type``
  + ``name``
  + ``target_name``
  + ``title``
  + ``created_at``
  + ``order``

* Template files (.html, .txt, .md) can contain YAML front matter.  If the first line is a bunch of dashes (``^[-]{3,}$``),
  all lines up to the matching dashes will be treated as YAML and added to that files context variables.

* Binary files can have front matter, too, but since you can't place it *in* the file, it is stored in a special ``files:``
  setting in the parent folder's config.yaml file.  It should be a dictionary with the key corresponding to the name
  of the file, and the value is the front matter for that file.  ``files:`` entries in ``config.yaml`` are not inherited.

* Everything in ``config.yaml`` and YAML front matter is available as a context variable in your templates.

* Templates are rendered using Jinja2_.

* StrangeCase points Jinja to your project folder, so you can use any directories you want in there
  to store layouts, macros, and partials.
  * layouts that are in ``layouts/`` are extended using ``{% extends 'layouts/file.j2' %}``
  * includes in ``anywhere/`` are included using ``{% include 'anywhere/file.j2' %}``
  * I suppose the convention is to have layouts/ and includes/ folders.

* In the project root, ``config.py`` is where you can place runtime things, like...
  * if you need to calculate a value (e.g. ``datetime.time``)
  * fetch some data from a database (*ewww!*)
  * import jinja extensions (or use 'extensions' in config.yaml)
  * import jinja filters (or use 'filters' in config.yaml)
  * register StrangeCase processors (or use 'processors' in config.yaml)

* If you need a page to be processed differently, set ``type`` to the desired file type in the config for that file/folder.
  For instance, the category index page should be ``type: categories``.

* You can prefix variables on a page with ``my.`` (e.g. ``my.title`` or ``my.parent``). I think it looks
  better in some places because it makes it clear where the content comes from (e.g. ``{{ my.title }}`` as
  opposed to just ``{{ title }}``).  Totally optional.

* Based on the file name, config.yaml, and YAML front matter, some config settings get changed during the build stage.
  See ``configurators.py`` for these methods.  See ``strange_case_config.py`` for the order.

--------------
DEFAULT CONFIG
--------------

You should study this to learn a lot about how StrangeCase works.  The reason I boast that StrangeCase is simple
is because *everything it does* can be controlled using the config. ::

    config_file: 'config.yaml'                # name of file that contains config
    host: "http://localhost:8000"             # hostname.  I'm not using this for anything, but it might be import for plugin authors one day
    ignore: ['config.yaml', '.*']             # which files to ignore altogether while building the site
    dont_inherit:                             # nodes will not inherit these properties
      - type
      - name
      - target_name
      - title
      - created_at
      - order
    file_types:                                 # how files should be processed.  some processors add to this list, like to associate images
        - [page, ['*.j2', '*.jinja2', '*.jinja', '*.md', '*.html', '*.txt']],   # with the image processor
    default_type: asset                       # if this is falsey, unassociated nodes will be ignored.
    rename_extensions:                        # which extensions to rename, and to what
      '.j2': '.html',
      '.jinja2': '.html'
      '.jinja': '.html',
      '.md': '.html',
    index.html: index.html                    # determines which file is the index file, which in turn determines "iterability" (index pages are not iterable)
    html_extension: '.html'                   # files with this extension are html files (`page.is_page` => `True`)

    # PROTECTED
    # these can only be assigned in the root config file, otherwise they will
    # be treated as plain ol' file data
    site_path: 'site/'                        # where to find site content
    deploy_path: 'public/'                    # where to put the generated site

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

You can override configuration - or add to it - via the command-line.
Here are all the command line arguments:

    -p, --project:   project_path
    -s, --site:      site_path
    -d, --deploy:    deploy_path
    -r, --remove:    remove_stale_files = true (default, but this can override -n)
    -n, --no-remove: remove_stale_files = false
    -c, --config:    config_file

(and of course)

    -w, --watch:     watch files for changes

You can set/add arbitrary configuration using any number of ``key:value`` arguments:

    + `key:value`:         any key/value
    + `key: value`:        these don't have to be "touching"

I use this to implement a simple code generator for my Sublime Text 2 plugins.  I run

    scase --deploy ../NewProject project:new_project desc:'A great new package'

See `My PackageTemplate <https://github.com/colinta/_SublimePackageTemplate_>`_ for an
example of how this can be used.

---------------------------
AND THAT'S (pretty much) IT
---------------------------

Jinja2 makes it easy to put pretty complicated logic in templates, which is really the
only place for them in this static generator context...

\...or is it !?  I’m wondering what kind of spaghetti nonsense these templates could end
up with (it's like PHP all over again!), and how that could be fixed.

Which leads right into...

------------------------
REALLY COMPLICATED STUFF
------------------------

This relates to the ``config.py`` and ``config.yaml`` files mentioned above.

Take a glance at the colinta.com repository.  It does most things that can be done.

You can define ``extensions``, ``filters``, "configurators", and ``processors``.

``filters`` is a dictionary of ``filter_name: package.path``.

``extensions`` is a list of ``package.paths``.

If you specify these in config.py, you can import the extension/filter and assign it to the list.  Otherwise, in config.yaml,
use a dot-separated path, similar to how you would write an ``import`` statement, but include the class name.

There are a couple built-in processors that are not imported & registered by default: categories and image.

In config.py, you can add context variables that need the **POWER OF PYTHON**.  Things like datetime.time().
I might add a way to do this in the YAML, but *probably not* (unless the community argues for its inclusion).


Example of all this nonsense using ``config.py``::

    # you must provide an initial CONFIG dictionary.
    # unless you want to do something crazy, it is best to import it from strange_case_config
    from strange_case_config import CONFIG

    # import the processors you want to use.  you don't have to do anything with them,
    # it is enough just to import them.
    from strange_case.extensions import image, categories

    # import the extensions and filters.  we still need to add these to CONFIG
    from strange_case.extensions.markdown import MarkdownExtension, markdown
    from datetime.datetime import time

    CONFIG.update({
        'extensions': [MarkdownExtension],
        'filters': {
            'markdown': markdown,
        },
        'time': int(time()),
    })

Equivalent in the root ``config.yaml``::

    extensions:
      - strange_case.extensions.markdown.MarkdownExtension
    filters:
      markdown: strange_case.extensions.markdown
    processors:
      - strange_case.extensions.image
      - strange_case.extensions.categories
    # cannot assign time to datetime.time.  DANG.

``extensions/category_ext.py`` has an explanation of how processors work, and how it was written.
I made it up as I went along, and ended up adding a ``Processor`` class that extends ``Node``,
and a concept of "populating" the tree after the initial build.  Read more in that file.  I
think it's a good system, but I'm open to friendly suggestions.

Last but not least: configurators.  These are really the work horses of StrangeCase.  They
look at YAML front matter, ignore files, set default processors, and so on.  If you need to
do the equivalent of a context processor in django, this is where you would do that.

Every configurator in ``config['configurators']`` is given the node config.  If it returns nothing,
the node is ignored.  Otherwise, you can modify the config, or create a whole new one, and return it.

See ``date_from_name`` for a good example of modifying the config based on the file name.


---------------
IMAGE PROCESSOR
---------------

The image processor uses PIL to create thumbnails.  The usual way to do this is to specify
the thumbnail size in a parent folder config, and then set `type: image` on all the image
files.  This is done in the image folder's config.yaml file::

    thumbnails:
        thumb: '480x480'
    file_types:
        - [image, '*.jpg']
    files:
        img_0001.jpg:
            alt: a great picture
        img_0002.jpg:
        ...

I've changed file_types so that all images are processed by the image processor, so you
don't have to write an entry for every file in the folder.

And of course, enable the image processor in your ``config.yaml``::

    processors:
        - strange_case.extensions.image


------------------
CATEGORY PROCESSOR
------------------

This processor scans your site pages, looking for pages that have a "category" property
in their config.  For every category, it builds a ``category_detail`` page that can list
the pages, and a ``category_index`` page to list the categories.

Enable the category processor in your ``config.yaml``::

    processors:
        - strange_case.extensions.category

And build ``categories.j2`` and ``category_detail.j2``.  The ``category_detail`` page
can be name anything (it will get renamed based on the category), but the ``categories``
page will keep its name/title/etc, so give it a sensible name.

In categories.j2 you can use the ``categories`` property to
iterate through the category_detail pages::

    ---
    type: category_index
    ---
    {% extends 'layouts/base.j2' %}

    {% for category in my.categories %}
      <li><a href="{{ category.url }}">{{ category.title }}</a> (<span>{{ category.count }}</span>)</li>
    {% endfor %}

In category_detail.j2 you'll have a ``pages`` property::

    ---
    type: category_detail
    ---
    {% extends 'layouts/header.j2' %}

    {% block content %}
    <ul class="posts">
    {%- for page in my.pages %}
      <li><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
    {%- endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endblock %}


-------------------
PAGINATED PROCESSOR
-------------------

This processor can break up a large folder of pages.  It is designed so that converting
from an index.j2 file to a paginated file is easy.  Let's say your existing blogs/index.j2
lookes like this::

    {% extends 'layouts/base.j2' %}

    {% block content %}
    <ul>
    {% for page in site.blogs %}
        <li><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endblock content %}

We'll change this to use pagination.

Enable the paginated processor in your ``config.yaml``::

    processors:
        - strange_case.extensions.paginated

And change the ``type`` to ``paginated``, and update the HTML to use pagination::

    ----
    type: paginated
    ----
    {% extends 'layouts/base.j2' %}

    {% block content %}
    <ul>
    {% for page in my.page %}
        <li><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <div class="pagination">
    {% if my.page.prev %}<a href="{{ my.page.prev.url }}">&lsaquo; {{ my.page.prev.title }} |</a>
    {% else %}&lsaquo;
    {% endif %}
    {{ my.page }}
    {% if my.page.next %}| <a href="{{ my.page.next.url }}">{{ my.page.next.title }} &rsaquo;</a>
    {% else %}&rsaquo;
    {% endif %}
    </div>
    {% endblock content %}


-------------
JINJA FILTERS
-------------

StrangeCase includes several Jinja filters that you can use in your templates.
Remember that in order to use a filter you must first enable it in your
configuration. For example to enable the date filter you must add::

    filters:
      date: strange_case.extensions.date.date

This will register a filter named *date* which is implemented by by
``strange_case.extensions.date.date``.

strange_case.extensions.date.date
---------------------------------

This filter formats a date. The input must either be a date in YYYY-MM-DD
notation, or the string *now* to always use the current date. If no date
is specified it is printer in YYYY-MM-DD notation.

::

   <p>The date is {{ 'now'|date }}.</p>


strange_case.extensions.date.uuid.uuid
--------------------------------------

This filter generates a UUID based on the provided input. The UUID is
generated by taking a SHA1 hash of the input combined with a namespace
identifier. The available namespaces are:

* ``dns`` for fully-qualified domain names as input
* ``url`` for URLs (default)
* ``oid`` for ISO OID input
* ``X500`` for X.500 DNs in either DER or text format

::

   <id>{{ 'http://myhost.com/articles'|uuid('url') }}</id>


strange_case.extensions.date.uuid.urn
--------------------------------------

This filter generates a UUID URN based on the provided input. This is often
useful when needing to generate unique identifies that must be URIs, for
example when generating an Atom feed.

The UUID is generated by taking a SHA1 hash of the input combined with a
namespace identifier. The available namespaces are:

* ``dns`` for fully-qualified domain names as input
* ``url`` for URLs (default)
* ``oid`` for ISO OID input
* ``X500`` for X.500 DNs in either DER or text format

::

   <id>{{ 'http://myhost.com/articles'|uuid('url') }}</id>

-----------------------------
SCSS AND CLEVERCSS PROCESSORS
-----------------------------

These two get associated with ``.scss`` and ``.clevercss`` files and compile them to CSS files.

::

    processors:
        - strange_case.extensions.scss_processor
        - strange_case.extensions.clevercss_processor

-------
TESTING
-------

I am currently (as of version 4.0.2) including tests::

    > pip install pytest
    > py.test

----
TODO
----

* Placing entries in ``**/config.yaml`` override parent configs, but i'd like to add a
  merging syntax to the YAML, as a little DSL.
