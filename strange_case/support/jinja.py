"""
Jinja support adds the following abilities:

1. Adds a ``YamlFrontMatterLoader``, which searchs the beginning of the file for
   YAML between two lines of an equal number of three or more dashes.

   These lines are stripped off before rendering.
2. Jinja has nice support for displaying errors, but the YAML front matter
   confuses things.  This module fixes that, too, using a ``StrangeCaseStr``
   which keeps track of how many lines to ignore.  The blank lines are included
   during compilation, and removed after the file is generated.
3. Provides a ``fix_paths`` function that returns a slash-separated relative path,
   even on Windows.

   Note: This function will also chomp any in-filename backslashes.
   Hopefully you don't have any of those in the relative path to your template.
